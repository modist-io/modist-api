Getting Started
===============

| **Welcome to Modist API!**
| This page should hopefully provide you with enough information to get you started defining, serializing, and validating config instances.

Installation and Setup
======================

Installing the package should be super duper simple as we utilize Python's setuptools.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pipenv install modist-api
   $ # or if you're old school...
   $ pip install modist-api

Or you can build and install the package from the git repo.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/modist-io/modist-api.git
   $ cd ./modist-api
   $ python setup.py install
